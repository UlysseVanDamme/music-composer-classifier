# Music Composer Classifier

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for a **comparative study** on classifying classical music composers based on their performance MIDI data from the **MAESTRO dataset**.

The model focuses on classifying music from five composers:

* **Johann Sebastian Bach** (Baroque)
* **Ludwig van Beethoven** (Classical/Early Romantic)
* **Frédéric Chopin** (Romantic)
* **Franz Schubert** (Romantic)
* **Franz Liszt** (Romantic)

---

## Results
The model is great at differentiating between different historical periods. However, simple statistical features are insufficient for distinguishing the styles of the Romantic composers.
